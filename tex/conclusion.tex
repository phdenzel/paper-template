\begin{section}{Conclusion}\label{sec:Conclusion}

  A short motivational argument again. Summarise the results again.
  Discuss the results, it's okay to speculate.
  Emphasise the important results, and the consequences.
  Communicate your message clearly, and summarise the important parts
  in bullet-pointed lists, like so:

  \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item Finding 1.
  \item Finding 2.
  \item Finding 3.
  \item Finding 4.
  \end{itemize}
