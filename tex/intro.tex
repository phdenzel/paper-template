\begin{section}{Introduction}\label{sec:Introduction}

  Introduce the problem...  Give lots of motivational arguments, and
  reasons why this work should be considered important. A historic
  background is a nice way to point out what has been done and what is
  still unsolved.  Give a lot of references some popular ones, some
  recent ones and a few self-promoting citations, e.g. \cite{Denzel16,
    Denzel19}.  Then say how this work tackles the problem and tries
  to solve it.  The last paragraph usually ends with a forcast of the
  following sections.
